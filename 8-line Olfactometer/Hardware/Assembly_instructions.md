## main manifold to top cover (with o-ring)

- (x1) Straight Adapter, for 1/4" Tube OD x 1/8 NPT Male
- (x1) main manifold
- (x1) top cover
- (x1) o-ring
- (x10) 4-40 x 1/4" screw
- (x10) 4-40 washer

<br>
Screw input fitting into main manifold.
<br>
Fit o-ring into main manifold groove. Place top cover on top of main manifold. Secure with screws & washers.

<br><br>


## proportional valves to main manifold

- (x8) proportional valves
- (x16) o-rings
- (x16) 4-40 x 5/8" screw

<br>
Connect proportional valves to main manifold.

<br><br>


## main plate

- (x1) main plate
- (x3) 4-40 x 1/4" screw

<br>
Attach main plate to main manifold using 4-40 x 1/4" screws.

<br><br>

## flow sensors

- (x8) flow sensors
- 1/4" OD 1/8" ID tubing
- (x8) male luer to 1/8" barb

<br>
Cut a ~1" piece of tubing. Slide the end onto the output (P2) of the flow sensor. Insert the luer barb into the other end of the tubing.
<br>
<br><br>

- (x8) o-rings
- (x16) 4-40 x 7/8" screw
- (x8) 4-40 x 3/8" screws, (x8) 4-40 hex nuts


<br>
Insert flow sensor input (P1) through the main manifold cover (with the o-ring groove facing away from the flow sensor). Slide o-ring onto the end of the flow sensor (same side as the o-ring groove).
<br><br>
Drop (x2) 4-40 x 7/8" screws through the main manifold. Fit the flow sensor input into the main manifold (header pins should slide through the slot in the main plate).
<br><br>
While securely holding the input (P1) of the flow sensor flush to the main manifold, secure the screws into the main manifold cover.
<br><br><br>
Secure flow sensors to main plate using 4-40 x 3/8" screws and hex nuts. (possibly connect PCB before doing so, to make sure it's all aligned)

<br><br>


## mounting brackets

- (x4) 4-40 x 1/2" screw
- (x2) M8 screws

<br>
Attach mounting brackets to main manifold using 4-40 screws.
<br>
Use M8 screws to mount main manifold (for convenience for rest of assembly)

<br><br>


## vial holders

- (x4) vial holders
- (x4) 4-40 heat set inserts
- (x4) 4-40 x 3/8" screws

<br>
Install heat inserts into vial holders.
<br><br>
Secure vial holders to main plate with screws.
