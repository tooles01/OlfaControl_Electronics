## 1: main manifold to top cover (with o-ring)

- (x1) Straight Adapter, for 1/4" Tube OD x 1/8 NPT Male
- (x1) main manifold
- (x1) top cover
- (x1) o-ring
- (x10) 4-40 x 1/4" screw
- (x10) 4-40 washer

<br>
1a) Connect input fitting to main manifold.
<br>
1b) Fit o-ring into main manifold groove. Place top cover on top of main manifold. Secure with screws & washers.

## proportional valves to main manifold

- (x8) proportional valves
- (x16) o-rings
- (x16) 4-40 x 5/8" screw

<br>
3a) Connect proportional valves to main manifold

<br><br>


## mounting brackets

- (x2) mounting brackets
- (x4) 4-40 x 1/2" screw

<br>
2a) Attach mounting brackets to main manifold
<br>
2b) Mount main manifold (for convenience for rest of assembly)

<br><br>


## main plate

- (x1) main plate
- (x3) 4-40 x 1/4" screw

<br>
Attach main plate to main manifold

<br><br>

## flow sensor tubing

- 1/4" OD 1/8" ID tubing
- (x8) male luer to 1/8" barb

<br>
Cut a ~1" piece of tubing. Slide the end onto the output (P2) of the flow sensor.
<br>
Insert the luer barb into the other end of the tubing.

<br><br>


## flow sensors to main manifold

- (x8) flow sensors
- (x8) o-rings
- (x16) 4-40 x 7/8" screw


<br>
Insert flow sensor input (P1) through the main manifold cover (o-ring groove facing away from the flow sensor). Slide o-ring onto the end of the flow sensor (same side as the o-ring groove).
<br>
Drop (x2) 4-40 x 7/8" screws through the main manifold.
<br>
Fit the flow sensor into place (using the header pin slot in the main plate).
<br>
While holding the input (P1) of the flow sensor flush to the main manifold, secure by tightening the screws through the main manifold into the main manifold cover. (Might have to push the main manifold cover up (towards the main manifold) until the screws grab on.)
