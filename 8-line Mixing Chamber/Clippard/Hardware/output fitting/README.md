## Nut for Precision Compression Fitting 10-24


#### Custom version of McMaster-Carr *Nut for 1/16" Tube OD Precision Compression Fitting for Stainless Steel Tubing* (8239K216)

<br>

The outlet thread on Clippard 8-MC heart_v01 was machined as a #10-24 thread. Therefore, the intended fitting ([McMaster-Carr 8239K216](https://www1.mcmaster.com/8239K216/), which has a #10-32 thread), was not compatible.

A custom nut was manufactured to fit onto the Clippard heart. The nut is identical to the McMaster-Carr part, with the exception of the thread pitch (changed to #10-24).
