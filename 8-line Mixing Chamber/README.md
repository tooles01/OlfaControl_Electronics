- **Clippard 8-MC heart**
    - Removed bottom depression, outlet changed from a male thread to an NResearch (1/4-28) female hole (matches the vial inlet holes)

    - Odor input hole (from the bottom) was previously not aligned with its connecting inlet hole (horizontal) - tied geometries together
